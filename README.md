## Starbucks Capstone Project for Udacity Nanodegree

This exploration is the final project challenge from the Data Scientist Nanodegree in Udacity. The dataset to be dealt with is simulated data on how customers make purchases and how their decisions might be affected by promotional offers of Starbucks. People in the simulation are provided with three different types of offers:

buy-one-get-one(BOGO)

discount

informational.

They produced various events, like receiving the offers, viewing the offers and possibly making purchases. Each person will have his or her own hidden traits on their purchasing patterns. The goal of this project is to identify groups of people that share similar purchasing patterns and if they are influenced by promotional offers.


## Getting Started
Please make sure you have a python 3.x version and the following packages installed, before you can launch the code:
